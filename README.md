# ThoughtChain-X: Enhancing AI Outputs with DeepSeek's Chain-of-Thought

[中文文档](README-CN.md)

ThoughtChain-X is an innovative AI system that leverages DeepSeek's powerful Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities in combination with other large language models to produce enhanced, high-quality outputs tailored to your specific needs.

## Key Features

- Utilizes DeepSeek's advanced Chain-of-Thought reasoning
- Seamlessly integrates with various large language models (e.g., Claude, GPT)
- Enhances output quality and depth through multi-model collaboration
- Flexible API configuration for customized model selection
- Real-time streaming responses for immediate feedback

## How It Works

1. **DeepSeek CoT Generation**: DeepSeek's model initiates the process by generating a detailed chain of thought for the given input.
2. **Model Integration**: The CoT is then passed to your chosen large language model (e.g., Claude, GPT) as a system prompt.
3. **Enhanced Output**: The selected model processes the CoT and generates a final, optimized response.

This unique workflow combines DeepSeek's exceptional reasoning abilities with the strengths of other top-tier language models, resulting in more comprehensive and insightful outputs.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ThoughtChain-X.git
   cd ThoughtChain-X
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your API settings in the `config.yml` file.

4. Run the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage Guide

1. Launch the ThoughtChain-X application.
2. Enter your API credentials for both DeepSeek and your chosen secondary model.
3. Input your prompt or question in the designated field.
4. Select the secondary model you wish to pair with DeepSeek's CoT (e.g., Claude-3-Sonnet).
5. Click "Generate" to initiate the ThoughtChain-X process.
6. Review the enhanced output, which combines DeepSeek's reasoning with the chosen model's capabilities.

## Example Workflow

Input: "Explain the potential long-term effects of artificial intelligence on job markets."

1. DeepSeek generates a detailed chain of thought, considering various aspects such as automation, new job creation, skill shifts, and economic impacts.
2. This comprehensive analysis is passed to Claude (or another chosen model) as a system prompt.
3. Claude processes the CoT and generates a final response, incorporating DeepSeek's insights with its own knowledge and language capabilities.

Result: A nuanced, well-reasoned explanation of AI's potential impact on job markets, combining DeepSeek's analytical prowess with Claude's articulate expression.
